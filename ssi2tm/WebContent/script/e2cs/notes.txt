INSTALL:
For sample files to work fine  adjust the EXTJS files and CSS files locations

NOTES: this new release is supposed to be compatible with 3x also but you have to adjust the paths  js and css files according to the version 
you wanna use. 

Also we have tested only on FF 3.5 , IE 6  only for the moment in the next days we will perform more test on other browsers cause 
we have virus issues on all other computers and we are restoring the OS and software meanwhile  you could sumitt posts or issues in 
Extjs forum, mail, chat apps ond so on 

NOTES 2: This new version 0.0.16 its in beta stage, we have tested on our own production environments and have worked so far but 
we do not recommed you chage to production environment until you are 100% sure this new release works according to your needs

NOTES 3: 
On the database samples you must ensure the database is proper configurated for version 3x due to many changes of language the stores 
need other options its not exactly like 2x

These sample files needs some adjustments 


NOTES 4 :
1.- For debugging check the files on Source folder
the order would be: 

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="calendar.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="locale/e2cs_en.js"> //choose your lang file on locale folder </script>  
<script type="text/javascript" src="calendar.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="monthview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="weekview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="dayview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="task.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="scheduler.js"></script>

2.- dbcal.php and dbcal_xml.php file contains php sample code to work for e2cs_test.sql table sample just install the .sql file on a clean database or 
testing database and adjust the code to access you database file 

3.- On AIR, ASP or Coldfusion adapt your code to return a valid JSON response acording to the sample and the 
database wich you're gonna use

4.- For use with jquery or prototype please check EXTJS documentation on EXTJS ADAPTERS 
for use with jquery or prototype on the forums

5.- For Adobe Air development please check all the Xtemplate objects in the source and 
adjust them to the initial loading of AIR because this will not work  
(check EXT samples about template objects)
